Creating a REST API using Node.js, Express.js and Mongodb that allow CRUD operations on user profiles
This project is a high level design in building a RESTful API for user profile operations
it requires some prerequisites such as having node.js, express.js and MongoDB and other packages installed in the running environment 
This project involves:
- Setting Up Environment
- Initialising the Project
- Install Dependencies
- Create a MongoDB model
- Set up Express APP
- Define CRUD routes
- Connect to MongoDB
- Test your API

 # There are a few assumptions in this project which include:
 - The running environment of the Js frameworks are alredy installed
 - the database structure is simple with less complex fields
 - the use of middleware functions are assumed
 - The tests for creating a user profile, to GET users endpoint in the API, updating and deleting a user profile are also assumed
